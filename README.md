# Hello, I am Adedoyin Emmanuel Adeniyi

## This Repository Contains My C Programming Journey From Zero To Hero :)

### In Each Directory, is a README.md file containing the description for that particular topic. Feel free to clone the project and run the codes. 

#### Don't forget to star this project and follow up for more

##### Happy Coding

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - prints hello world to the terminal on a new line
 * Return: 0 on success

 */

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
}
```

Soon i would be building projects and uploading them here
